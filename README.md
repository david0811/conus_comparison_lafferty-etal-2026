## Abstract
Projections of climate hazards carry uncertainty from multiple sources, but their relative importance is poorly characterized for the metrics and spatial scales most relevant to risk assessment. Here, we combine three downscaled climate model ensembles---including downscaled large initial condition ensembles---to characterize how relevant uncertainties affect projections of several temperature- and precipitation-based risk metrics across the contiguous United States. We focus on long-term trends of aggregate indices as well as the intensity of rare events with 10- to 100-year return periods. Our results reveal that uncertainty patterns differ systematically between average and extreme indices, across recurrence intervals, and between temperature- and precipitation-derived metrics. We show that temperature metrics are sensitive to the choice of emissions scenario and Earth system model, while internal variability can dominate for precipitation-based metrics. Uncertainty from downscaling is small for relative changes but considerable for absolute values. Additionally, we find that the parametric uncertainty related to extreme value distribution fits can often exceed climate-related factors, particularly at recurrence intervals of 50 years or longer. These results underscore the difficulty of providing generalized guidance for climate risk assessment and emphasize the need to consider all salient uncertainty sources.
