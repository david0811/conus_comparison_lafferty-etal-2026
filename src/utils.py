def map_store_names(ensemble, gcm, member):
    """
    Map GCM and ensemble member names to standardized storage naming conventions.

    This function standardizes GCM (Global Climate Model) names and maps ensemble
    member identifiers, particularly handling special cases for LOCA2 ensemble data.

    Args:
        ensemble (str): The ensemble name (e.g., "LOCA2", "GARD").
        gcm (str): The GCM identifier, which may use abbreviated naming conventions.
        member (str): The ensemble member identifier.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - gcm_name (str): The standardized GCM name.
            - member_name (str): The mapped or original ensemble member identifier.

    Notes:
        - GARD GCM names are automatically converted to their full names:
          "canesm5" -> "CanESM5", "ecearth3" -> "EC-Earth3", "cesm2" -> "CESM2-LENS"
        - For LOCA2 ensemble with CESM2-LENS GCM, member names are mapped using
          the loca_gard_mapping dictionary if available.
        - Otherwise, member names are returned unchanged.
